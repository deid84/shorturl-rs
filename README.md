# shorturl-rs

An illustrative demonstration showcasing the use of Rust to create a simple and lightweight URL shortener.

### The Stack

- **Rust:** (can you believe it?)
- **Axum:** To serve static assets and power the backend API
- **Askama:** For HTML templating, facilitating shared layouts, scripts, CSS, etc.
- **htmx:** For reactivity on the UI.
- **Tailwind:** To have a simpler CSS management
- **Rust:** Yes, I understand it might sound repetitive, but it's the language I'm passionate about, so I'll continue to embrace it!
- **Axum:** If you've read my previous article, you might already be aware that it's my preferred tool for backend development.
- **SQLx:** To manage Postgres, I prefer, whenever feasible, to bypass ORMs and their associated overhead. Instead, I opt for solutions that allow me to utilize SQL directly
- **PostgreSQL:** This will serve as the database where we store our URLs, along with potential analytics-related data.
- **Docker:** Even though it might not be the optimal choice for production, I've opted to use it because, for teaching purposes, it significantly accelerates the setup phase.
- **Askama:** Though I've heard there are faster alternatives, given my time constraints, I'll stick with it for now for templating.
- **htmx:** I've had a positive experience with it in my previous tutorial, so I'd like to delve deeper into it this time to give my frontend reactivity.
- **Bootstrap:** To avoid too much similarity with my previous tutorial, I've decided to switch from Tailwind to Bootstrap for styling the frontend.
